THE REPUBLIC OF DOGS

If in past Ages' Lore we pry
An Answer there to seek
To that age-old Conundrum: Why
The Mighty serve the Meek;

We find it said that Wars are bred
Of Arrogance the Heirs;
And Arrogance, it's also said,
Is born of Millionaires.

To Proposition One, one can
Most heartily assent.
But Proposition Two? Too gray -
The Truth's non-evident.

For Arrogance more Kindred owes
To Penury and Need -
Paternally the Lineage goes,
Or through maternal Seed.

More plainly said, it's not the Case
That Arguments arise
When everyone has ample Space
And lots of Meat and Pies.

For normally an Onslaught's Course
Goes from lean northern Ways -
An indigent and hungry Force
On southern Gluttons preys.

The oldest Provocations for
Those Arguments that lead
To Strife, and hence to all-out War,
Are Jealousy and Need.

Which, though as Cousins they relate
To Arrogance and Vanity,
Are Children of an underweight,
Poor, slim, unfed Humanity.

A Simile one can invoke
From them who learn of Nations;
Who tell of a four-legged Folk,
In canine Populations.

If we perceive that State serene
Whose Denizens are Dogs,
A Pet political Machine
Where Canines are the Cogs,

We'll find that if there's Peace among
These Terriers and Poodles,
The Cause be found when on the Tongue,
Of Victuals there's Oodles!

And that when civil Strifes afflict,
To vex a canine Nation,
It's when one large Bone's only licked
By one of high-born Station.

Who may, by sharing it between
A few select Elite,
Who privileged of the fine Cuisine
Exclusively may eat,

A Polity around the Bone
Invent, quite oligarchic;
Or keep it for himself alone,
And form a State monarchic.

A Logic parallel they'll use
For Bitches impregnated,
It being hard to know just who's
The Cur with whom she mated.

In Matters delicate, like these,
Much Jealousy abounds;
And Envy, like a Plague of Fleas,
Infests the House of Hounds.

Then that once civil Avenue
In universal Strife
Erupts; till one comes into View
Who's looking for a Wife.

Who is with Wealth and Courage greater
Than the Rest endowed -
He nabs the pregnant Prize to mate her;
Whence a motley Crowd

Of Canines envious commence
A long, discordant Howling -
A Pack of jealous Malcontents;
A Choir of Snarls and Growling.

And if one sees their Ranks extend
Beyond their own Dominion,
Whether their Homeland to defend,
Or, in their own Opinion,

Impelled by Provocations dire
To launch the first Attack,
Another Commune to acquire
Held by another Pack,

One learns from Argument equivalent
That in every Case
It's not the slightest bit ambivalent
(Cutting to the Chase)

Both Need and envious Desire
(Perceived or really true,
The Argument does not require
One or the other View)

To an Extent the Urge provoke,
Along with pompous Pride,
In fractious Clans of canine Folk
Ambitiously allied.

THE TWIN HEIGHTS OF PARNASSUS

Who e'er regards that System's Keys,
Applying its Economy
To pedagogic Polities
Or rational Autonomy,

Shall surely find the Reason for
The present mighty Fracas.
To Truth of why the Parties war
The Inquiry shall take us.

We shall the Issues juxtapose,
Then equitably judge
Between the hot contending Foes,
Who has the better Grudge.

But of the Course and Outcome here
Of that Dispute we'll not
Be fast to ascertain, I fear,
For Passions are so hot -

The Parties both are all enraged
Their Claims are so fantastic,
Their Passion cannot be assuaged.
Such Rhetoric bombastic!

It isn't likely they'll refrain
From Argument profuse,
Their ardent Spleens in check to reign
And try to make a Truce.

As to the Way in which the Fray
Initially did start,
One long time Resident did say,
Those Foes first grew apart

When Disagreement did arise
Concerning one high Plot
Of two, aspiring to the Skies,
Which first the Sun's Rays caught,

Whereon had dwelt some Residents
For Ages past, uncounted,
Till these unhappy Malcontents
A lower Summit mounted.

The former are as Ancient known,
The latter Modern styled,
Who, frowning at their lesser Zone,
A list of Griefs compiled.

And sent a Messenger to brief
The Aboriginals,
To grumble, whine, complain, and beef,
With sniveling Moans and Scowls.

They do bewail with Vehemence
How greatly vexed they are,
And how, from their base Tenements,
They can't see very far.

The View is ruined, as they claim,
When from the West they're peering;
The lofty Ancient Height's to blame,
Their own Horizon shearing.

To Strive a War to obviate,
They did a Plan propose:
Those in the higher Hill's Estate
Politely could transpose

Themselves and all their Property
Down to the lesser Peaks.
(The Modern's Liberality
Amused the Ancient Greeks!)

Or else, with Leave, the Moderns could
Arrive quite well equipped
With Implements for Dirt and Wood,
And Dreams of Mountains clipped.

To which the Ancients did retort
That they were quite astounded
To hear Proposals of this Sort
By Colonists propounded,

Whom they allowed in Tenements
So proximate to dwell
Without imposing heavy Rents.
"Well, let us now dispel

"Such Notions as are entertained
In your ungrateful Brains,
That one Day you might be ordained
To lodge on lofty Planes."

Concerning their own higher Place,
To which the Ancients claimed
To be an embryonic Race,
The Landlords long acclaimed,

They would not hear of Forfeiture
Or of Relinquishment.
Such Talk was simply horse Manure!
There could be no Descent.

And if their Promontory's Height
Did crop the View from where
The Moderns lodged, perhaps their Plight,
Seen from a Perch less rare,

Might be considered balanced by
The Fact that 'neath its Cloak
They might not in full Sunlight fry
Nor in harsh Torrents soak.

As to the Plan which they might hatch
The higher Peak to prune,
Their puny Tools would be no Match,
As they would find out soon;

For out of adamantine Rock
The Mountain high was made.
Their stupid Effort it would mock;
The stubborn Palisade

Would fracture all their feeble Tools,
All their Ambition crumble;
For all the Hammering of Fools
That Hill could never humble.

The Moderns can take Counsel sound
Instead to elevate
Their own confounded meager Mound,
Rather than to berate

Their Neighbors perched so far above,
Who gladly would permit
Such Enterprise. Indeed they'd love
To offer Help for it.

But that munificent Design
Irately was declined.
The Moderns only can malign
What they have not designed.

And so the Disaccord became
A Struggle much prolonged,
With Charges hurled of Guilt and Blame
And who got hurt or wronged;

Supported on one Side by Heart,
And Valor which transcends
Mere fervid Daring, on the Part
Of Generals and Friends;

And on the other Side alone
On Conscripts limitless,
For Times when they are overthrown,
Hangs their Hope of Success.

INTERRMENT OF THE TOMES

Great Fusillades of Ink with Skill
Are flung in these Disputes,
That through the Weapon named a Quill
At each the other shoots.

With fierce, proficient, deadly Aim
And great unerring Skill,
Each Side the other tries to maim,
Demoralize, and kill.

The Man who that vile Fluid made
Mixed two foul Elements,
Which are in equal Portions weighed
The Soldiers to incense.

First from the Spleen he siphoned Gall,
Known for a bitter Taste.
Then it's with Poison that we call
Copperas deadly laced.

And as the Greeks were wont to raise,
When Tussles halted tied,
Two Monuments to publish Praise
Paid for by either Side,

(A nice Tradition that of late
The Learned have revived)
Now when they end some bloody Spate
All those who have survived

Do post commemorative Plaques
To tell how Things came down,
How they prevailed in all Attacks
To claim the Victor's Crown.

Memorials like these are framed
And hung out for a While
For Passers-by to view; and named
According to the Style:

Rejoinders, Brief Considerations,
Arguments, Objections,
Replies, Remarks, and Confutations,
Answers and Reflections.

They then are sorted by their Weight,
And pond'rous ones are shipped
To Galleries to lie in State
With other weighty Script.

The blood-like Ink in these grand Books
Embalms the Soldiers' Souls,
Whose Spirits flow in ghostly Brooks
To soak these martial Scrolls.

At least that's what some Persons say.
But I would just suggest
That with Libraries it's the Way
It is where Corpses rest;

Where some Professors of the Slayed,
Maintain these Spirits must
Float o'er the Grave till is decayed
The Body, turned to Dust.

Then, so that School of Thought affirms,
The Brutum hominis
Leaves, when the Body turns to Worms,
And grants it rest in Peace.

And if this Doctrine we apply
It then can be assumed
That Ghosts around those Volumes fly
Which are herein entombed.

At least until they shall decay,
Which happens, it appears,
To some in one fast, fleeting Day,
To other ones in Years.

Since Books of Controversy are
By Ghosts the most frenetic
Attended (for they are by far,
Of all, least homiletic),

To help avert Engagements sore
They're kept in separate Crypts,
Chained in a Room, behind a Door,
Maintained for savage Scripts.

THE SEEDS OF DISSENSION

The Story goes, this is the Way
The Rite did first begin:
Duns Scotus' Works went on Display
Where Books are stored within.

With Aristotle he did vow
Old Plato to remove
From his Position honored now,
Where Bishops do approve;

A Haunt where for eight-hundred Years
He in Tranquility
Had lived. So then these Mutineers
Have won the Victory.

Then Harmony to guarantee
An Order was endorsed
Fierce Rivals overgrown would be
Into fast Fetters forced.

By such Precaution Order might
In Libraries have reigned,
Had not an arrant, horrid Blight
Of Books Admittance gained;

Especially malignant Scrolls
Malevolent Critiques,
Authored by vile and vicious Souls,
About Parnassian Peaks.

The Day these Volumes showed up here
I raised my Voice to say
That Controversies should appear
Unless, to hold at Bay,

The vying Factions' Advocates
Were to each other fixed,
That thus convolved their baneful Traits
Would cancel, intermixed.

It seems that I was not far off
Dissension to divine;
And since at my Advice they scoff
Affairs to Feud incline.

If my Suggestions had been taken
Rancor would have halted;
The Place would not have been all shaken
With its Peace assaulted.

As of this Fighting Rumors fly
And all are seeking News,
And I have Gifts in great Supply
To advertise my Views;

And Peers of mine and Patrons plead,
Both here and o'er the Channel,
For a Report, I have agreed
To narrate a true Annal.

THE WATCHMAN OF THE LIBRARY

The Sentinel that had most Rank
Among these Books of Kings,
One who from Danger never shrank,
And did exalted Things,

Had for the Moderns plead their Case;
And had Parnassian hopes
Two Ancient Guardsmen to displace
From off these lofty Slopes.

But when he tried to scale that Sector,
Plenteous ample Mass
And inward pointing mental Vector
Hindered him, Alas!

To soar in Theory he was prone,
High floating Clouds to meet;
But in Reality he'd groan,
Pain in the Butt and Feet.

His Effort foiled, he did repine
And for the Ancients took
A bitter Umbrage: "I'll assign
A dark and secret Nook

To every Book containing Praise
For any Ancient Thing.
The Moderns I will honored raise,
Their Panegyrics sing."

Another thing that we observed
On every Shelf around:
That many Books in their reserved
Locations were not found.

Some said that Soot scholastic blown
By some foul Modern Breeze,
Got into those twin Organs thrown,
By which the Keeper sees.

Said others, he devoured the Bugs
That in Professors dwell,
Which acted on his Brain as Drugs
That made his Anger swell.

Still others claim, from Strolls unlit
His Brain became demented;
Most evident and clear is it,
He's all disoriented;

For 'twixt Des-Cartes and Hobbes, disgraced,
Was Aristotle stuck.
With Withers and with Dryden placed,
Was hapless Virgil's Luck.

Now from those who Forbearance show
Towards the Modern Party,
One was sent off, their Ranks to know -
How numerous and hearty.

All their Affairs he organized,
His Energy unflagging.
A Tallying he supervised,
His Feet were never dragging.

At Fifty-Thousand stands the Sum,
Light Cavalry abounding;
The well-armed Foot seemed to have come
From a Defeat resounding.

For they had Ordnance obsolete,
Their Vestibules were crude;
Their Steeds would often miss a Beat,
Though with great Height endued.

But there is one Contingent small
Who with the Ancients barter;
They are outfitted best of all,
Their Uniforms are smarter.

All during the Embranglement
Dispute intensified.
Invective venomous did vent
From Spleens on either side.

One Ancient, lone, quite out of Place
Upon a Modern Shelf,
Then made an Overture with Grace,
Suggesting he himself

Impartially could arbitrate
The Matter here in Question.
If all cease to recriminate,
And follow his Suggestion,

He'll offer most conclusive Proof
The Ancients still deserve
To live upon that Height aloof,
Their natural Reserve,

By virtue of the length of Time
These Tenants there resided
Where few could ever think to climb;
And how they Help provided

To Moderns most unsparingly -
Who then returned their Presents
By scorning them uncaringly,
And treating them as Peasants.

Their Reasoning they did rebuff
As problematical;
Stating their vaunted "Ancient" stuff
Was just nonsensical.

Less Ancient was the Time when God
The Earth created newly;
More Modern, though it seems quite odd,
Antiquitas saeculi.

We are more Ancient now than when
The World did first awaken;
Juventus mundi it was then -
So says Sir Francis Bacon.

These did deny Dependency
Upon all Ancient Norms;
In their brief young Ascendancy
They'd fain invent new Forms.

"It may be true that one or two
Within our Ranks have sunk
So low as to acknowledge Due
To bygone Ancient Bunk.

"However, the Remainder of
Our faithful Modern Crowd,
Have firmly to remain above
This type of Traffic vowed.

"Which ones of us avoid this Stench
Is not hard to determine;
It's mostly English, and some French,
Not Spanish, Dutch, or German,

"Who have to the Extent conferred
Till now with Ancient Folk,
So little that a single Word
With them they never spoke.

"We use but our own Kind of Strain
Of Stallions and of Mares;
From Borrowing we do refrain,
And tend our own Affairs.

"We manufacture all our Spears
To our own Plans and Whim;
The Garments of our Cavaliers
We weave and stitch and trim."

Then Plato in a nearby Berth
Remarked, sage and benign,
That these who bragged were in a Dearth
Of tailored Clothing fine;

And that their Nags looked underfed
And faltered when they strode;
With rusted Arms and in frayed Thread
An Army on them rode.

So with a hearty Laugh he heaved
And then he said: By golly,
For certain, that he now believed
Their Arrogance and Folly!

The Moderns in their recent Plans
Did take but little Caring,
To talk among each other, sans
Their true Intentions baring.

For those who Salvos first let fly
In that intense Debate
(Who should live closer to the Sky;
Who had more Right innate)

Did carry on, with such great Sound,
Of launching an Attack,
That Temple, list'ning, heard and frowned,
Determined to fight back.

The Ancients he did notify
Of all he did observe,
Who all their Force assembled nigh
Their Honor to preserve.

Some Moderns changed their Fealty
And joined the Ancient Side,
Like Temple, who boasts Loyalty
To those who were his Guide;

Those who had offered him to train,
And loved him as a Friend;
For them he boldly did Campaign
Their Bastion to defend.

THE BEE AND THE SPIDER

'Twas here that all the Wrangling paused
In each Contending Faction;
A strange Event took Place that caused
A fabulous Distraction.

Up near the Ceiling in a Room
Beside one Window large,
Quite safe from Duster, Mop, and Broom
A Spider was in charge.

Fat, swollen up to twice his Size,
Up on his Throne he sat;
And gnawed on countless filthy Flies
And many a murdered Gnat.

Like human Bones an Ogre's wont
Out of his Lair to cast,
He scatters Flybane, nonchalant,
From his grim, black Repast.

With radiating Boulevards
And Beltways round endowed
So he his Castle closely guards -
The Moderns would be proud.

Through its Periphery you wind,
A central Dais you see,
On it the bloated King's Behind
Sits in vain Majesty.

Out onto every Avenue
He sallies forth for Prey,
Or when his Foe comes in to View
He sallies forth to slay.

For quite some Time in Plenty there
The Spider lived his Life;
No Foe disturbed his peaceful Lair,
No Famine brought, nor Strife.

No Birds flew down out of the Sky;
Not one unwelcome Guest;
No People cleaning way up high
To sweep away his Nest.

Until out of pure Happenstance,
From Regions high and free
It was the Pleasure of Mischance
Here to conduct a Bee.

Whose curiosity a Pane
Of broken Glass doth spy,
At which he can his Entrance gain,
And through it he doth fly.

He soars about the Citadel
The Spider's Toil contrived;
But on a fragile Curtain fell
Just after he arrived.

The Strain of that unequal Load
The Citadel sunk under,
And every Node of that Abode
Was well nigh torn asunder.

Thrice he endeavored free to burst,
About he tossed and thrashed;
Great Waves of Shock the Place traversed,
Then in the Center crashed.

Observing this chaotic Din,
This paroxysmic Bobbing,
The Spider thought that Nature in
The Throes of Death was throbbing.

Or that bold Lucifer approaches
With his fearsome Throng,
To take, on him who eats Cockroaches,
His Revenge, ere long.

At last he did some Courage find;
Resolved to boldly go,
He ventured out with valiant Mind
To ferret out the Foe.

But now the Bee no longer toiled;
Loose from the Trap he was;
Still he was very badly soiled,
Swathed in a sticky Gauze.

And when from Cobweb Remnants he
His Wings to clean did strive,
He longed in his Extremity
To be back in his Hive!

The Spider did his Fort survey,
And its Dilapidation;
Its Ruin and its Disarray
Caused him great Consternation.

So that he stormed around and swore
And like a Madman cursed;
His Anger boiled up more and more
Until he nearly burst.

For on the Bee his Gaze was cast,
And putting two and two
Together he deduced at last
The How, the Why, and Who.

"Was this unsightly Chaos here
The Fault of your neglect?
May Trouble find you, Grief, and Fear;
A Pox your Health affect!

"You think I've nothing else to do
But to repair and mend
The Damage that is caused by you
When you my Palace rend?"

The Bee was now completely pruned
From every grimy Thread,
And with a dulcet Voice, well tuned,
Unto the Spider said:

"I will no more come near this Lair
For never was I caught
In such a Pickle, nor, I swear,
In Water quite so hot!"

"I'll show you better Manners, Sir,"
The Spider said, "but nay,
My Custom's not abroad to stir
My Enemies to slay."

"Have Patience pray," replies the Bee,
"Your Substance do not spend,
You will need all of it, you'll see,
This Palace rent to mend."

"Thou Rogue," the Spider's miffed reply,
"Show more Respect unto
A Person whom the World holds high,
As better far than you."

"A good Jest," said the Bee, "Please do
One Favor - I'm amused -
Some Reasons give me, one or two,
Why all the World's confused."

At this the Spider's Posture grew,
For Controversy's Sake;
Into a fierce Debate he flew,
His Honor was at stake.

To urge his Reasons scurrilously
He angrily resolves;
But Reason to a large Degree
Quite rapidly dissolves.

For to Objections from his Foe
His Mind was firmly closed;
In ignorant Conviction, Lo,
His tiny Brain reposed.

"A Rascal such as you," he said,
"Cannot compare with me.
A Vagabond without a Bed,
No Home nor Stock have ye.

"You've no Belongings of your own
But one: that Pair of Wings,
And two: a Drone-pipe monotone
That only one Note sings.

"You plunder over Plot and Field,
In Pastures not your own,
Freeloading on the fruitful Yield
That other Men have sown.

"You'd rob a Nettle, I suppose,
Whether it shines or rains,
As easily as you'd rob a Rose;
This Theft the World disdains.

"Now me, I'm tame and better trained,
Not near as wild as you;
Within myself is all contained -
So well endowed are few.

"This Home I fabricate with Care;
I from myself extrude
All necessary for repair."
Thus went their angry Feud.

Replied the Bee, "At least you grant
I honestly acquire
My Wings to fly, a Voice to chant,
My Freedom, and a Lyre.

"For then to Heaven alone am I
Obliged for every Thing,
The Wings with which I soar so high,
The Music that I sing.

"And Providence in vain would not
Provide such Gifts as these
But with some noble Purpose fraught -
She blessed the Bumblebees!

"Yes, I procure for my own Taste
From all the Garden's Flowers;
But there's no Victim and no Waste,
And nothing dies or sours.

"Of you as Architect, I fear,
To say, I have but little;
A Math that's flawed, it's all too clear,
A Thread that's weak and brittle.

"Method and Toil might well be in
Your House of Snares and Traps
But both of us saw with Chagrin
That it did all collapse!

"I hope henceforth this Clue you'll take
That Durability,
Far more than Art and Method make
A Building Defect free.

"You other Creatures, so ye boast,
No Obligation owe,
To draw and spin a Web you most
Sufficient are - but Lo,

"By that that issues from it we
The Well's Health can adjudge;
And you are very full, we see,
Of Poison, Dirt, and Sludge.

"From whence does this Defilement come?
To whom is owed this Bane?
I do believe you Ordure from
Some other Source obtain.

"Unto your own inherent Dirt
Some other Bugs donate,
The venal Venom that you squirt
Contains their poison Hate.

"The Matter comes to this, in short,
Who's on the nobler Side,
He that inside a four-inch Fort,
With overweening Pride,

"Feeds and engenders on itself,
Turns all to Venom there,
And leaves a Cobweb on the Shelf,
And Flybane everywhere -

"Pray is it him - or is it he
That far and wide doth roam,
And with much Thought and Industry
Brings Wax and Honey home."

So heatedly did they debate
And with such fervent Vigor,
The Battle 'neath them did abate,
Not one Troop pulled a Trigger.

But all stayed silent, Breath all bated
With Anticipation,
To see what Outcome would be fated
From the Disputation.

Ere long the Bee impatient grew
To hear his Foe reply,
And straightaway away he flew
To Flower beds nearby.

Leaving the Spider all irate
And almost nigh to burst
With Oratory, to inflate
His Ego vast, accursed.

AESOP'S DESCANT

On this Exigency it fell
To Aesop to expound.
For he had just been made to dwell
Among the Moderns, bound

In Shackles harsh upon a Shelf,
Ravaged on half his Pages.
Seeing the Risk he changed himself
Through varied vulgar Stages;

Until, seen in a Donkey's Shape,
The Curator believes
That he's a Modern. To escape
At Leisure he conceives.

Unto the Ancient Shelves he came
Just when the Bee came in,
And with the Spider fretfully
The Fracas did begin.

With Satisfaction he observed,
As each the other blamed;
And then with Fervor unreserved,
When finished, he exclaimed:

That never had he seen before
Two Matters so related.
The Fight of those above the Door
And here below equated.

Those feuding had with great Finesse
Their Conflicts organized;
No single Fact was left to guess,
All Sides they scrutinized.

"We need but juxtapose the two,
What issues forth compare,
Apply our findings for a Clue
To fathom our Affair.

"Was ever any Mark or Trait,
Of Moderns so thematic
As is this Bug, his Bearing, Gait,
And Puzzles enigmatic?

"He argues in behalf of you
His Brethren, with much Force,
By boasting that he gives no Due
To any outside Source,

"And only from his own Insides
His Fruits he's fabricating.
How well he sums, counts, and divides,
His Tenements creating.

"Then in behalf of us the Bee,
Opining, counters thus:
The Moderns' Product is the Key,
How they compare with us.

"The Talent, Brains, and cunning Sense
That they are always boasting
Proves but to be a big Pretense;
Insouciant, vain self-Toasting.

"The Edifices built by you
With System, Craft, and Sleight,
Endure long after their Debut,
Only if out of Sight;

"Much as those Nests the Spider weaves,
Long Pendency enjoy,
Only if overlooked in Eaves,
Where none come and destroy.

"The one Thing that I can recall
That Moderns can assert
To be the true Fruit of their Gall,
Their Venom, and their Dirt,

"Is that contentious Corpus filled
With Slander, Slur, and Rumor
That seems as though it's been distilled
From an arachnid Humor.

"This wholly from themselves, they say,
Do they expectorate,
Though supplemented by the Prey
Whose noxious Bane they fete.

"We Ancients claim Naught other than
Our Soaring and our Speech;
Just as the Bee with his Wings can
To Heights transcendent reach.

"These only are our native Gifts;
Hard Study then avails
The Stuff of Truth divine that lifts
Us to Celestial Pales.

"So that instead of Filth and Grime
We choose to line our Nest
With tasty, splendent, Fare sublime
And then the Earth is blessed."

THE ROSTER OF COMBATANTS

When Aesop ended these Remarks
An Hubbub did commence.
Between the Books flew angry Sparks,
Contentious and intense.

Their Ire anon got so inflamed
That both contending Groups
Resolved that War should be proclaimed,
And gathered all their Troops.

'Neath Banners streaming each Side teams
In Galleries remote,
And there they plot Intrigues and Schemes,
One at another's Throat.

In fervid Feuds the Moderns Vie
To choose who'll be their Chief;
Kept by the Fear their Foes are nigh,
From internecine Grief.

The Ardor was among the Horse
Epic in the Extreme.
Each Soldier tries to be perforce
An Officer supreme;

First Milton, Dryden, Withers too,
And Tasso, full of Woe,
Then, mirthful, singing into view
Came Cowley and Despreaux.

Des-Cartes and Hobbes the Bowmen led,
Gassendi was close by.
Their pointed Shafts to Heaven sped,
And from the Earth did fly;

Never again on Earth to stray,
But like Evander veer,
To fade, as shooting Stars decay,
High in the Atmosphere.

And Stink-Pot-Flingers from the freezing
Heights of Switzerland
Paracelsus bore - unpleasing
Fumes announce his Band.

There Harvey's Squadrons did advance,
Part for the Fight equipped
With Scimitar and Sword and Lance,
Their Points with Toxins tipped;

And Part with Ammunition stuffed
With foul and nasty Leaven,
A chalky Dust that will, if snuffed,
Waft one to Hell or Heaven.

Brigades of Infantry then came,
All Mercenaries rotten,
Davila, Polydore, by name,
And others best forgotten.

Next Regiomontanus brought
Brigades of Engineers;
Hypotheses for Weapons, Thought
For Swords, Conceit for Spears.

The others were a Legion large
Bewildered and befuddled.
One Bellarmine was seen in charge
While through the Fray they muddled,

Endowed with great, colossal Size,
And with prodigious Brawn,
But lacking soldierly Supplies,
Undrilled, and Valor gone.

The Ancient Ranks are sparse and thin
The Cavalry are led
By Homer; Light-Horse spurred to win,
Brave Pindar at the Head.

And Euclid, Elements in hand,
Commands the Engineers,
While Aristotle leads the Band
Of Bowmen, Plato's Peers.

COUNCIL OF THE GODS

When these Contentions sharp were nigh
To break out into Brawls,
Renown, housed in a Lodging high
In academic Halls,

Flew straight up near to Jove's Abode,
And, faithful to the Facts,
Told how Affairs might soon explode
Betwixt these Tomes and Tracts.

Then Jupiter moved to begin
A Gathering didactic,
Which he assembled promptly in
A Theater galactic.

The Congregation being met,
He tells why they've been beckoned:
Because two Factions are upset,
And, Heaven's Stake be reckoned,

A lethal Fracas might erupt
'Tween rival Partisans;
One old and pure, and one corrupt,
Infernal Charlatans.

The Deity of Blaming spoke,
The Modern's patron Saint;
Much Empathy he doth evoke
With an intense Complaint.

Then Pallas in behalf of all
The Ancient Phalanx made
A stiff Rebuttal to this Gall,
Which half the Quorum swayed.

The noble Body found it hard
To rate who most deserved
Their Blessing, Homage, and Regard;
This Jupiter observed.

He ordered that the Book of Fate
Should now be forthwith sought;
And Mercury who's never late,
A triple Journal brought.

Containing Tales of bygone Times
And Narratives of Now,
Tomorrow's noble Works, and Crimes,
Who'll rule and who will bow.

The Binding of these bulky Books
Was holy Poultry Hide;
A fine argentous Plate for Looks
Was lavishly applied.

Jove read the Judgment with no Sound;
Its Import he anoints.
Those hoping for him to expound
He greatly disappoints.

Outside the Temple where the Group
Of Gods do rendezvous,
A populous and frisky Troupe
Of vassal Gods we view.

Subservient to Jove they bow,
On Earth his Will to show.
Through Space together leashed they plough,
All tethered to his Toe.

Yet when to parley these appear,
To transfer Information,
To get too near his Chair they fear,
Without his Approbation.

Below his Feet they'd best stay put
And reverential be
Absorbing Learning from that Foot,
Conveyed through Tubes fill free.

The Gods subordinate are called
Blight, Fortune, Falls and Wins,
At least by Beings who have crawled
'Neath Suff'ring, Grief, and Sins.

But Deities have different Terms
By which these things are known:
As Second Causes, Jove affirms,
They're called before his Throne.

To some of these subaltern Gods
Instructions Jove conveyed;
Then with obliging Bow and Nods
All instantly obeyed.

From on a Tower at that Place
Wherein the Books disputed,
They entered in without a Trace,
Invisible and muted;

Which followed after they had held
A brief Confabulation.
The dueling Factions' Fate they spelled,
At Jove's firm Proclamation.

ENLISTMENT OF CRITICISM

At this time Momus, full of Fears
For his own Modern Brood,
In mind of old prophetic Seers,
And in a fretful Mood,

Unto a Place of great Discord
His soaring Course did veer -
Where Criticism dwelt - a Lord
Most horrible to fear.

In Nova Zembla's frigid Air
Atop an all-white Peak
She dwelt, and lying in her Lair,
All gorged on Fare antique,

Amongst half-eaten Folios
Upon which she did feed,
She was in Company with those
Of whom she is the Seed.

Her Father, blind, on her right Side,
Stupidity his name,
And on her left, her Mother, Pride,
One most conceited Dame.

Her female Sibling danced around,
Opinion she was named;
Irresolute and often found
By Obstinance inflamed.

Her many Children play about
Ill-mannered, dull, and vain;
Assured, much Nonsense do they spout,
Much Learning they do feign.

This Monarch having feline Claws,
An Ass in facial Features,
Was ever full of self-Applause,
Disdain for other Creatures.

Upon the Discharge of her Spleen
She Nourishment ingests;
And Vipers at her Teats are seen
Sucking from fulsome Breasts.

And though they sucked with hungry Greed
The Flow from that foul Cup
Replenished is with greater Speed
Than those could drink it up.

"Dear Goddess! our Disciples are
In mortal Danger now.
Against their mortal Foes they spar;
I want to ask: Just how

"Can you, while they in Battle fight,
Be unconcerned? You must
Arouse yourself with all your Might
And justify their Trust.

"At once unto the British Isle
With all Alacrity
Proceed, and I'll beg and beguile
Recruits from Deity."

His Errand finished he did now
Retire in utmost Haste,
Whereat the fat lethargic Frau,
Her placid Mien replaced

With wrathful seething Rage, arose
And launched a loud Harangue:
"It is from me that Wisdom grows
In Idiots who sprang

"As Children from my Psyche hatched,
Much wiser to become
Than Parents, as absurd despatched,
Ridiculous and dumb.

"By me do little Boys in Schools
Judge all things philosophic.
And glib sophisticated Fools,
With Fruits most catastrophic,

"The deeper Depths of Science plumb;
And Arm-chair Critic Jerks
To specious Understandings come,
Berating Poets' Works;

"With no idea of the Sense
The Theme, the Plot sublime;
They'll fault the Grammar and the Tense,
The Rhythm and the Rhyme.

"By me do no-good Heirs exhaust
Their Common Sense and Wit,
As their Inheritance is lost,
Ere they've laid Claim to it.

"For stripping Wit from Verse don't doubt
It's I who claim the Credit.
I am the one who Meaning out
Of Poetry do edit.

"And shall I be opposed by some
Perverse old-timer Bards?
I think not. Sister, Parents come,
And Children, be my Guards.

"Ride in my Chariot with me
My Parents and dear Sister,
Our Modern Army is, I see,
In Trouble. Let's assist Her.

"From Altars catch that votive Whiff
Of burning Volumes torched.
It's that devoted Scent I sniff
From classic Verses scorched."

When she and every Passenger
Are ready off to Fly,
They are, a niggling Harbinger,
Transported through the Sky,

Traversing Territory vast,
By noisy cackling Fowl.
Reaching the British Isle at last,
O'er London they do prowl.

And what a Flood of Parvenu
On Covent Garden Shops
She liberally pours, and too
On Gresham Students drops.

Upon this paper Battlefield,
Where Books in Arms are dressed
And Rolls of fractious Fate unsealed,
She came at last to rest.

Invisible, she hastens in,
And on a Shelf she lands
Where many Volumes once had been,
Now emptied, there she stands.

There every Officer and Troop
A-mustering, she viewed;
To fierce vindictive battle Group
Positions she was clued.

Now by maternal Instinct moved,
A-stirring in her Bowels
On seeing one whom she approved,
Of Consonants and Vowels

A Master, but of Letters not,
A Paradox quite odd,
A Bowman whom she had begot
But not by any God.

'Twas Wooton of the Thread reduced
Assigned him by a Muse;
His Fabric on the Earth is loosed
To muddle and confuse.

To this Chief in a Regiment
Of those who draw the Bow,
With sympathetic Sentiment
She did resolve to go;

But not until, as Gods are quite
Well able to devise,
She vamped into a another Sprite
Of quite a different Guise.

For she did fear that her bright Face,
Ablaze with Light divine,
Could blind a Man of mortal Race
If on him it did shine.

And so in Prospect Octavo
Herself she doth assemble;
A bland lactescent Folio
She roughly did resemble.

Composed of sallow Sheets on which
Her Parents, Boys, and Girls,
A poison Liquid black as Pitch
Lay down in vulgar Swirls.

In this Disguise she did advance
Toward her Modern Pupils;
She was, in Bentley's Dress and Stance,
Devoid of any Scruples.

"Bold Wooton, why does this Platoon
Inactively repose?
The present Time is opportune
To hurl offensive Blows.

"Unto the Generals we ought
At once make haste to go."
Thus nursing on her Spleen she brought
A Viper foul to throw.

It flew straight into Wooton's Maw;
Round in his Skull it whipped.
Out popped those Orbs with which he saw,
His Faculties were flipped.

Then two most favored of her Brood
She bade attend him near:
Devoid-of-Wit and Manners-Rude,
To whisper in his Ear.

As soon as he was thus endowed
She faded in a Cloud.
The Hero to this Goddess vowed
To make his Mother proud.

BEGINNING OF THE FRACAS

And now, at that predestined Time
Hostilities were broached;
But ere I into Detail go,
By other Authors coached,

I feel obliged to beg for Ink
And Tablets by the Barge
Which would still insufficient be
This Labor to discharge.

PARACELSUS VS. GALEN

Speak, Clio, tell us who first raised
His Weapon high to strike.
'Twas Paracelsus, Chief of those
Dragoons who bear the Spike.

His Javelin with Power thrown,
A Missile straight and fierce,
At Galen darted fast and true
His mighty Shield to pierce.

This Greek courageous took the Blow
And he emerged the Winner;
The sharp end pierced the outer Plate
Then splintered on the inner.

ARISTOTLE VS. DES-CARTES

Then Aristotle seeing how,
With angry Countenance,
Did Bacon of the livid Brow
With Virulence advance,

Drew from his Quiver, stretched the Bow,
And sent an Arrow fast,
Which cleared the daring Warrior
And o'er his Helmet passed.

But it went whizzing straight and true
And hit Rene Des-Cartes
And at a Flaw, near where he saw,
His Visor it did part.

The Cover tough and Parchment Page
It tore a Swath clear through,
And with exact Trajectory
Into his Eye it flew.

In Agony he spun around
Assaulted in the Cortex,
His doom was to be pulled in Death
Down into his own Vortex!

HOMER VS. SUNDRY MODERNS

Then Homer leader of the Horse
Came on a raging Steed.
A Bridle could not tame the likes
Of this impassioned Breed.

Among the Foe he pranced about
And killed all that he passed;
Pray Goddess, tell whom first he slew,
And whom he slaughtered last.

First Davenant came on his Horse,
Much armored for Protection.
His was a Steed not known for Speed
But known for Genuflection.

An Oath to Pallas he had made
That ere he from the Fight
Departed, Homer's Shield no more
Would shine with Luster bright.

But he had no Conception of
The Power Homer had.
Him Homer ground into the Dust,
His End was swift and sad.

Then with his Weapon sharp he slew
That Modern, Denham, fat;
Descended from Apollo, by
A mortal Dame begat.

The heav'nly Part Apollo made
A lumined Orb divine;
The earthly Part upon the Ground
Lay groveling, supine.

Then Wesley fell, a Victim of
His Horse's savage Kick;
Perrault was off his Horse removed
And with a mighty Flick

Was caused to zoom across the Field,
Impacting Fontenelle
So hard that both unto their Brains
Were made to bid Farewell.

VIRGIL VS. DRYDEN

Then from the Horse's leftmost Flank
Came Virgil in his Saddle;
Upon an energetic Steed
He rode with Legs astraddle.

To find a worthy Enemy
Upon the Foe he gazed;
At Dryden's most enormous Horse
He looked with Awe, amazed:

With enervating Prancing high
Across the Field he bounced;
His coming was with noisy Din
Of clanging Arms announced.

These Cavaliers advanced to move
As close as one Spear's throw;
When this Intruder paused to say:
"I think it apropos

"That ere in Combat we engage
We ought to have Chat."
He lifted up his Mask and then
It was apparent that

His Helmet was five Times too big
For his vestigial Face.
Which at the Back was found within
Excessive empty Space.

It seemed much like the Lady
In a Lobster situate;
Or like a Rodent underneath
A Canopy of State;

His Voice was suited to the Face,
Diminutive, faint
"I'm kindred to your ancient Race."
Said he with shrill Complaint.

Then he suggested they should trade
Their Truncheons, Shields, and Spears;
And Virgil, in a Haze, was swayed,
For to offend he Fears;

Although his was of finest Gold,
The other Iron, rusting,
Which on the Modern, to behold,
Appeared misplaced, disgusting.

Then Steeds to switch they did agree
But at the Time to fight,
Poor Dryden in his Pants did pee
All overcome with Fright.

LUCAN VS. BLACKMORE

Upon a Mount most volatile
Pharsalia joined the Fray,
And wheresoever he did turn
The Foe with ease he'd slay.

Then Blackmore tried to intervene
More Slaughter to prevent.
He tossed his Javelin which missed,
And in the Ground it went.

Then Lucan let his own Lance fly
This Modern Foe to kill,
But Aesculapius unseen
Deflected it with Skill.

"Brave Modern I perceive some God
Protects thee," Lucan said,
"For were my Arm not contravened
Thou surely wouldst be dead.

"So let us cease this Rivalry
And trade our Tack for Favors."
Some Spurs on Blackmore he conferred;
A Bridle Lucan savors.

HORACE VS. CREECH

Lucretius then a Lesson teaches
To a Modern Mime;
The somber Throat of Thomas Creech's
Stretched, before his Prime.

The Deity of Dullness made
A Vapor in the Mold
Of Horace, with a Steed and Blade,
Soaring, in Bearing bold.

Our Modern sees this Phantom fly,
And felt a great Delight;
He follows, but it floats too high,
For him to face and fight.

At length it brought him to his End,
A bleak eternal Nap
Beside his Mentor, Sire, and Friend,
That made Brittania's Map.

PINDAR VS. COWLEY

Then Oldham Pindar hunted down,
Leaving him with the Slain,
And other Moderns of Renown,
Including Aphra Behn.

Avoiding Movement in straight Lines,
He'd pivot, bend, and swerve;
Those pirating him he designs
To frighten and unnerve.

And by his nimble Power great
Through many a lyric Poet
His heavy Lance did penetrate,
Whenever he did throw it.

When Cowley that brave Hunter spied
His bounteous Bosom kindled;
And mirroring that Manner, Stride,
And Bearing, greatly dwindled,

Did try, to the extent that he,
With Art bland and reflected,
And on a Mount of feeble Knee
And Gait might be expected,

To come and fight this Bard of old;
But when the two came nigh
So that the Spears which each did hold
Were both prepared to fly,

The Modern's Weapon through the Air
Sped in a faulty Arc,
And his Opponent's Life did spare;
In Dirt its Point did park.

The Ancient then a Shaft let sail,
So heavy and so grand,
That fifteen Moderns, weak and frail,
Can't lift it off the Land.

With little effort Pindar raised
That mighty Lancet high;
The Modern Army was amazed,
How true he made it fly.

Poor Cowley's Life was barely saved,
As a Protection mighty
Against that giant Spear he waved,
A Gift from Aphrodite.

Now both brought out their gleaming Blades
But Cowley hesitated;
The Modern Hero's Memory fades,
His Skill much overrated.

The Arms he held fell to the Earth,
Three Times he thought to flee,
Each Time he suffered from a Dearth
Of Strength himself to free.

At length unto the Ancient Foe
With Arms high in the Air
He plead: "These Weapons down I throw,
My Life, Oh Pindar, spare!

"Associates of mine when told
That I have been unhurt,
And am an Hostage whom you hold,
Shall Wealth to you divert."

"Thou Worm!", Pindar replied, "No Purse
Can hold a Sum so big
As from your Head to lift the Curse
That I pronounce, thou Pig!

"Your Flesh shall Food for Vultures be;
Let Scavengers your Hide
Devour." Then with one Whack did he
That Modern Wretch divide.

Unjoining from the Part below
To Earth the top Part tumbled;
Over the Modern gasping: "No!"
Hoofed Steeds stampeding stumbled.

His Horse in Panic o'er the Soil
Runs 'neath the severed Rider;
A Mistresse bathes him thrice in Oil,
A healing Branch beside her.

Turned thus into a peaceful Dove,
With Feathers velvet soft,
She latched him to her Cart of Love,
Conveying her aloft.

THE APPEARANCE OF BENTLEY

Now, as the Hour is getting late
And on the Moderns' Part
Enthusiasm doth abate,
And all are losing Heart,

A mercenary Sergeant lame
Out of the Legions came,
Intending Victory to claim -
And Bentley was the Name.

Big, but attractive he was not,
With Height, but with no Might;
His Outfit made of mismatched Parts
Was quite a motley Sight.

And great the Noise as he went past,
As thuds a heavy Lump
Of Metal base, that hits the Ground
And makes a muffled Thump.

Corroded was his Helmet Mask
With Air from his foul Lips;
A rankling, vile, offending Bile
Out of the same Source drips.

A Whip in his right Hand has he,
And in his left he carries
An Urn of feculent Debris
The Poop with which he parries.

Thus fully armed he marches on
To where the Modern Brass
Ponder the pending Denouement -
How things should come to Pass.

And they made Sport, when him they spied,
Of his misshapen Body;
His Outfit striving it to hide
Just made him look more shoddy.

His Penchant for Reviling had
In Politics some uses;
Though oftentimes it's been quite bad,
The Pain that it produces.

For he would use as an Excuse
The slightest Provocation
To heap upon his Chiefs Abuse
Instead of Veneration.

He was annoyed to see the Foe
Triumphing in the Field,
And thought it would be apropos
If all to him would yield.

The Modern Leaders, he oppugns,
Are found in different Niches:
They form a bunch of brainless Goons,
And bungling Sons of B-tches,

And vapid Jerks, Morons inane,
With all their Marbles gone,
Rapscallions, ignorant and vain,
And Sycophants that fawn.

And he maintains if he were Chief
The Ancients, haughty, proud,
And arrogant, would ne'er have been
Their Victories allowed.

"You lazy Sloths at Rest repose
And fail to do your Duty;
Then if brave Men despatch our Foes
You hope to have the Booty.

"The Enemy I'll not engage
Lest I am guaranteed,
From those I slay their Weapons stay
With him who made them bleed."

SCALIGER'S CASTIGATION

Then Scaliger responded thus:
Thou Prattler reprobate;
In your Opinion only, you're
This Perorator great.

The Venom that thy Hatred hath,
Thy Tendency to rail,
And thy Propensity to Wrath
Turns fresh Thought into stale.

With fiendish Traits, mean, heathenish,
Hath Schooling furnished thee;
A Doctor of Resentment with
A Virulence Degree.

Familiarity with Verse,
Hath made thee more prosaic,
What some Men polisheth makes Thee
A boring, trite Mosaic.

An Education in the School
Has given thee no Charm,
But rather made thee quite a Fool
And done less Good than Harm.

No Soldier more afraid than thee
Doth our Battalions stain;
But be thou confident of this:
Your Booty you'll retain.

Thy Flesh let Insects eat that do
On human Carrion Feast;
Thy rancid, tortured, loath Remains
Be pounced on by some Beast.

ENCOUNTER WITH AESOP AND PHALARIS

To answer, Bentley dareth not,
Half blind with Anger he
Now leaveth, all determined on
Some grand Entelechy.

A Friend for whom his Heart doth burn
Joins with him in the Quest,
They scout the Ancient Legions for
One lone, or one distressed.

They tromped on top of Comrades slain,
Then round their Army's Flank;
Then northbound through Bone strewn Terrain
Where rotting Corpses stank.

To Aldrovandus' Grave they ran
(Skirting the western Side),
Of whom, said Ogilby, that Man
For lack of Canvas died.

With Trepidation they approached
The Foes' brave forward Troops;
And like voracious hungry Hounds
Sought for fazed, injured Groups.

As when a Pair of venal Mutts
By Avarice imbued
Team up to search, all wanting Guts,
For unsuspecting Food.

Thus prowling, drooling through the Night
They roam among the Sheep
Owned by a Farmer affluent,
He being fast asleep.

From overhead upon them beats
A lucent lunar Beam.
One can observe the dearth of Nerve
Of that obnoxious Team.

They are not bold to let a Sound
Escape their canine Traps;
Seen in that Light their Sins are found,
Or in a Pond perhaps.

But one of them espies the Sphere
Surrounding their Location;
The other o'er the Fields doth Peer,
Of this strange new Plantation.

In Hopes of finding half-chewed Fare
Dismembered by some Vulture,
So this devoted, darling Pair
Bags Prey from Ancient Culture.

Afar off they two Outfits see
Of blinding Brilliance, borne
Upon a giant branching Tree;
By daring Soldiers worn,

Who nearby in a Nap did snooze.
The hunting Comrades view.
Which on this Quest should leave they choose,
And Bentley will pursue.

Tangled in Thought, and Dread and Fear,
A-marveling he goes;
Phalaris brave, with Aesop near,
In Slumber both repose.

The two he would despatch to Hell,
And so he crept up near;
But ere his Sword upon them fell
Here came the God of Fear.

Who grabs him with hibernal Hands
And from felt Peril pending
Removes him, for the Place he stands
To Harm perceived is trending.

Then suddenly the Ancients moved,
Who had been resting still,
For though they slumbered, Reveries
Their dormant Minds did fill.

An evil Poet threw a Spear,
Phalaris heaved him, scowling,
Into his Oven. One can hear
A brazen Bovine howling.

A Donkey wild in Aesop's Fable
Stamped and scattered Crap
That fell, as it escaped its Stable,
In his Eyes and Lap.

WATERS OF THE HELICON

Now from the dozing Duo here
Himself thus to defend,
He runs off with their fighting Gear,
And searches for his Friend;

Who had been in the Interim
Attempting to complete
A Quest that might provide for him
Some bold and daring Feat.

At last he found a Fountain famed;
A River it doth spawn.
And in the human Tongue it's named
The noble Helicon.

Here Wooton paused to be renewed
For he was dehydrated,
And at that Moment in the Mood
To be invigorated.

Three Times into the Stream he dips
With desecrating Paw.
Thrice from his Grip the Moisture drips;
Before it wets his Maw.

To be down closer with his Lips
Flat on the Ground he lies;
Before his Tongue the Water sips,
Down fierce Apollo flies.

The Inundation off he cut;
The flood dammed by Apollo,
The Modern found he could naught but
Wet Ground unpleasant swallow.

For even though there is no Source
In all this mundane Sphere,
From which a Rivulet doth course
More fresh, more clean, more clear;

Yet on its Bed there is a Bunch
Of nasty Silt impure;
A Meal that none would want to munch -
About like horse Manure.

Apollo once petitioned Zeus
For this, to teach and train
Those seeking its anointed Juice
With mundane Mouths to drain:

That to imbibe Refreshment here
They must be careful ever
The Fountain's Source to stay quite near,
To whet restrained endeavor.

WOOTON VS. TEMPLE

There near the Source two valiant, brave,
And noble Chieftains rest;
One, Temple, who his fealty
To Ancient Names professed.

His Headgear he removed and it
Into the Waters dipped.
Refreshment from this healthful Spring
In large Amounts he sipped,

Facing away from Wooton, who
Him seeking, lost his Nerve,
But reveled that if him he slew
Great Fame lay in Reserve.

So he believes, the foolish Clown
Inane, naive, and vain,
Rave Paeans from his Leaders down
Upon his Head will rain.

With Relish he imagines that
The Modern Lords' Esteem
Upon him falls; but soon enough
He snaps out of his Dream.

For where in all the Modern Race
Is there one brave Recruit,
That can an Arrow Face to Face
At this brave Ancient shoot?

In Battle he appears to get
Protection from Apollo;
And if in Danger, you can bet
That Pallas him will follow.

"But if my Honor is to be
A Critic's Apotheosis
Then please allow me this Decree,
This fortunate Prognosis:

"That my Spear into Temple's Heart
Might enter, with your Lady's
Consent, that his Soul will depart
And ever burn in Hades.

"That I unharmed and homeward turned,
Having fulfilled my Duty,
Might come, replete with Loot I've earned
From him, this Battle's Booty."

For his Appeal doth Momus and
His Madam intercede;
And so at Deity's Command
In Aiming he'll succeed.

But all his further vain Intents
Were by an adverse Blast
From Gods controlling all Events
Into the Ether cast.

With Force intense one Spear he flung,
Great Momus granting Aid;
In furry through the Air it sung
But from its Target strayed.

No Organs penetrated were;
A Belt the errant Lance
From Piercing deeply did deter;
It fell to Earth, by Chance.

The Modern whom he would destroy
Felt no Blow on him land,
Nor noticed Wooton's arrant Toy
As it fell on the Sand.

Now Wooton could have had great Fame
For sending a sharp Spear
That Struck, with no retorted Aim,
A Chief by all held dear.

Apollo fumed with angered Eyes
To see his Stream degraded
By Wooton's weighty Shaft, that flies
By his base Mother aided.

Then stealthily he changed his Guise
Into a Fey sans Name;
And, Noise not making, from the Skies
To youthful Boyle he came.

Attention he directs unto
A Weapon on the Ground,
Then to the Modern. "Chase! Pursue!
Retaliation bound."

BOYLE'S FINAL TRIUMPH

Brave Boyle had on a Suit that from
A Pantheon of Lords
Came as a Gift he used to plague
Yon heinous rival Hordes.

See how his Manner and his Mien
Resembles some brave Beast,
In arid rainless Regions seen
Far in the South and East;

Commissioned by a Parent old
To find some Game to snare,
By being savage, brave, and bold,
And bring Home to his Lair.

He hopes to come upon a Prey
That's worthy of his Honor;
A Fiend ferocious in his Way,
Anon to be a Goner.

But if a Donkey comes along
With whiny grating Squeals,
This philanthropic Animal,
Reluctant though he feels

His Paws to taint with such polluted,
Noxious Blood and Gore,
Still so annoyed at how he hooted,
He will hear no more.

For as a mean and naughty Tale
The gentle Gender hears,
And tells to ten or twenty Friends
List'ning with itching Ears,

So Echo doth repeat his Rants,
Sung in a noisy Scale,
With more Enjoyment charged than chants
Pandion's Nightingale.

Thus the Demesne of his Domain
He meaning to maintain,
Begins to chase this deafening
And funny looking Bane.

So Boyle doth after Wooton chase;
But with a weighty Load,
The Man must mitigate his Pace
To a less nimble Mode.

Now Bentley, whom he cherishes,
Shows up with Armor lifted;
'Twas Aesop's and Phalaris's
Who into Dreams had drifted.

Perceiving him to have the Gear
Belonging to his Fellow,
Which he himself had made appear
To shine ornately yellow;

He turned, for Wooton he forgot,
Revenge he frowning vows
Upon this Thief, for Anger hot
His Fervor doth arouse.

The both of them he was intent
To cleave in little Sections;
Alas away they quickly went
In opposite Directions.

And as a Widow who doth Spin
To earn a meager Pay,
If to her Worry and Chagrin
Her Ganders fly away;

Then frantically around the Mead
From here to there she raceth,
To gather them with arrant Speed
Her errant Birds she chaseth,

And they with an annoying Din
Across the Moorland dart;
So Boyle to follow doth begin
As both these Men depart.

But when they saw that their Attempt
To throw him off their Trail
Was met with nothing but Contempt,
And all to no Avail;

They moved in a united Stance
To try and fend off Harm;
And Bentley heaved a heavy Lance
With his malignant Arm,

Whence Pallas an Advantage gave
As on the Spear's sharp End
He forms a hollow Tip of Lead,
For he was Boyle's best Friend.

Then Boyle, now noticing his Chance,
With his right Hand he raises
A very long and lethal Lance.
At this close Duo gazes;

He lets it with unerring Aim
And savage Power fly;
And Bentley, to protect his Frame,
For he's about to die,

Drops low his Hands; the sharpened Pole
Goes through both Arm and Torso;
Continuing, to punch a Hole
In him whom he adores so.

It was as though a Chef impaled
Some Fowl upon a Spit.
His pointed metal Rod had nailed
These faithful Friends, both hit.

They fell, their Limbs all riveted
To one another's Frames;
In Death as Well as Life convolved,
Notorious their Names;

So tightly joined that Charon thought
One Ferry would suffice -
They Passage o'er his River bought
For half the normal Price.

A fond Farewell I bid you two -
A Couple nonpareil.
A lasting Fame I vow to you
In my poetic Style.
